# My Product Design Process

I have been working in UX design since 2018, and in this article, I will summarize my standard design process using Markdown syntax.

### A Quick Summary

Here is a quick summary of my design process:

1. Review the requirements and understand the user goals.
2. Explore existing solutions and common UX patterns.
3. Research user needs and mental models.
4. Brainstorm and explore at least three options.
5. Discuss with the team and make a decision.
6. Create a low-fi prototype to communicate the solution.
7. Design the user interface following the design system.
8. Provide the design file to the development team with all necessary details.
9. Check the product before launch to ensure it follows the design file guide.
10. After launch, track the success metric, gather feedback from the market, and iterate the feature if necessary.

### 01 Review the Requirements

First, I get the requirement from the product manager, and I try to answer some key questions:

- Who are our users? What are they trying to do with this feature?
- In what scenario are they going to use this feature?
- What is the relationship of this feature with other components in the system? Are there any limitations?

I also identify the user's desired outcome and how to measure success.

### 02 Explore Existing Solutions

Next, I explore the existing solutions in the market. This step is essential for getting inspiration and starting brainstorming. Following common UX patterns in the market can help users learn how to use the app more easily.

### 03 User Needs Research

When I'm unsure about the user's mental model and their scenario of using the product, I conduct user needs research. This step is helpful in understanding what your users care about.

### 04 Brainstorm and Explore

Using the market research and users need research, I brainstorm and explore at least three options. I make sure to make them diverse enough and put them in front of the user scenario. I also consider the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

### 05 Team Discussion and Decision Making

I present the options to my teammates and explain how I analyzed the scenario and which one I recommend the most. Using a prototype, if necessary, can help. I also make sure to understand different stakeholders' opinions, like whether it's doable in programming and how it will influence marketing. In this step, I mark down the success metric of the feature and how to test it.

### 06 Low-fi Prototyping

After the team has reached a basic agreement, I create a low-fi prototype to make sure everyone is on the same page. I use the prototype as a communication tool to show how this solution is better than others. I also involve some users to help us do the basic testing and to understand what they are thinking about the product.

### 07 UI Design

Next, I start to design the user interface, following the design system as much as possible. I use the grid and name components correctly.

### 08 Design Handoff

After completing the UI design, I provide the design file to the development team. In this step, I mark all noticeable details of the design, such as margin, rules of the textbox, etc.

### 09 Before Product Launch

Before launching the product, I check it to ensure it follows the design file guide.

### 10 After Launch

After the product launch, I track the success metric to see feedback from the market. If necessary, I talk to some users and iterate the feature.

By following these ten steps, I ensure that my design process is comprehensive and user-centered.
